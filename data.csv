Beta-alanine has been shown to enhance muscular endurance. Beta-alanine supplementation can also improve moderate- to high-intensity cardiovascular exercise performance, like rowing or sprinting. When beta-alanine is ingested, it turns into the molecule carnosine, which acts as an acid buffer in the body. Carnosine is stored in cells and released in response to drops in pH. Large doses of beta-alanine may cause a tingling feeling called paresthesia. It is a harmless side effect.",https://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/

It is classified as a nootropic because it sensitizes neurons and provides mental stimulation. Caffeineâ€™s main mechanism concerns antagonizing adenosine receptors. Adenosine causes sedation and relaxation when it acts upon its receptors, located in the brain. Caffeine prevents this action and causes alertness and wakefulness. This inhibition of adenosine can influence the dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and adrenaline systems.",https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/

It's primarily made in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and pancreas. It stores high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine which are donated to ADP, regenerating it to ATP, the primary energy carrier in the body. This role in energy production is particularly relevant under conditions of high energy demand such as intense physical or mental activity. Creatine can be found in some foods and is most prevalent in meat and fish. Athletes commonly take it as a powder or in capsules.",
